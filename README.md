# Simple Todo App

A task management application that allows users to create, track, and delete to-do items. This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by refactoring code into modular, reusable classes.

## Functionality

Task Management: Add new tasks with a title and due date using a modal form.

State Persistence: Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted with a toggle, or delete them entirely.

Form Validation: Real-time validation for the "Add Task" form to ensure proper data entry.

Dynamic Rendering: Automatically generates and renders task elements based on user input and initial data.

## Technology

OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): Logic is encapsulated into Todo and FormValidator classes for better maintainability.

ES6 Modules: Used import/export syntax to organize the codebase into separate, logical files.

Validation: Implemented a custom validation class that handles error messaging and button states.

DOM Manipulation: Advanced use of JavaScript to interact with and update the HTML structure dynamically.

UUID: Utilized for generating unique identifiers for each task.
